Usage:
	When the program is executed, 4 sections of the screen are shown
	The top three show the stack, undo stack, and variables(not implemented yet)
	The bottom section is the command interface
	You may enter in a valid string of RPN and the calculator will execute it
	All commands run will be pushed onto the undo stack
	The results of all commands will be pushed onto the main stack
Commands:
Basic Arithmetic
	"+": Addition
	"-": Subtraction
	"*": Multiplication
	"/": Division
	"^": Exponentiate(b^a)
Trig:
	All Trig commands have two forms; <command> and <command>d
	The former assumes radians, the latter degrees
	Only the radian forms will be listed, if you need it in degrees, or have degrees
	or whatever, put a "d" on the end
	"sin" : Sine(a)
	"cos" : Cosine(a)
	"tan" : Tangent(a)
	"atan": ArcTangent(a)
	"asin": ArcSine(a)
	"acos": ArcCosine(a)
Stack Operations:
	"c"   : Delete the top element of the stack
	"s"   : Swap the top two elements of the stack
	"d"   : Duplicate the top element of the stack
	"cc"  : Clear the main stack
	"ckck": Clear ALL stacks, including the undo stack
Misc:
	"r" : pop the top element and set the precision to that
	"u" : Undo the last operation
	"q" : Exit
